### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am Hamza, I am a 2021 Graduate of Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Since the beginning of the corona virus pandemic that has started all over the world, I have been intensively learning software and trying to develop projects.

I am developing backend projects using C# EntityFramework code first and Linq. For desktop software, I make detailed programs using devExpress components. I usually use Windows application, Blazor and Flutter as UI in the Backend projects I prepare. You can browse my GitHub codes for my C#, Flutter and Java projects.

Apart from these, I have a machine learning article named "Basal metabolism calculation with electrocardiography signal" published in the journal and a project named "Artificial Intelligence Based Onychomycosis Detection" with image processing, which was presented and published at the 2021 National Dermatology Congress.
